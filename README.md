The purpose of this Project is to give a brief idea about what has been done in the training. It comprises of various activities/orientation programs constituting the training.  Broadly, the various activities which made a part of our training were automation of the Linux System based on TUI and shell scripting. In section 1, basic commands of Linux have been described. This section also gives brief description of file management and directory management. The next section enlists the user management and file system security along with the hard disk partitions and implementation of the servers and special assignments like swap partition and automatic job scheduling handled by the mentors & a brief description of the programs that we had the opportunity to undergo. 
Overview of shell scripting, functions in shell and brief description of conditional statements were covered. During our course of summer training, a special initiative was taken by Linux World Pvt. Ltd. to enhance our knowledge in RedHat Certified Engineer (RHCE) & RedHat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA).  
RHCE constituted following topics:
	•	Installation of RedHat 6 Linux 
	•	Basic commands-
		o	Creating, Editing, Renaming & deleting file/directory.
		o	Basic date, calendar, calculator, browser commands.
	•	File System Security- owner, group, others permissions
	•	Disk Partitions-
		o	Basic hard disk partitioning
		o	Logical volume partitioning
		o	Swap partitioning
	•	Setup & Configuring Servers-
		o	Apache
		o	ssh, Telnet
		o	FTP, Mail
		o	Samba, NFS
		o	NIS
The Shell Script is a computer program designed to be run by the UNIX shell, the command line interpreter. The various dialects of shell script are considered to be scripting languages. The project of automation has been first designed in shell scripting where the bash shell is used to run the code created. After this implementation it is shifted to TUI interface.

Text-based user interface (TUI), also called textual user interface or terminal user interface, is a retronym that was coined sometime after the invention of graphical user interfaces, to distinguish a text-based interface that processes events from command-line interfaces that operate sequentially. An advanced TUI may, like GUIs, use the entire screen area and accept mouse input. A TUI does not necessarily provide line-by-line output, although TUIs only use text, symbols and colors available on a given text environment. This TUI gives the final effect to the project making it a , one stroke application to use Linux without the knowledge of any command running behind the scenario for the naive users.
